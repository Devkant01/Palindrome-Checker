# Palindrome Checker

This is a web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that can check whether a given string or number is a palindrome or not. It also handles complex strings by removing special characters before checking for palindromes.

## Features

- Checks whether a given string or number is a palindrome
- Handles complex strings by removing special characters
- Works with both strings and numbers

## Usage

1. Enter a string or number in the input field.
2. Click the "Check" button.
3. The application will display whether the input is a palindrome or not.

## Examples

### Example 1: Checking a string

Input: "racecar"
Output: "The input is a palindrome."

### Example 2: Checking a number

Input: 12321
Output: "The input is a palindrome."

### Example 3: Handling complex strings

Input: "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!"
Output: "The input is a palindrome."

## Test Cases

Here are some additional test cases to verify the functionality of the application:

1. Input: "hello"
    Output: "hello is not a Palindrome."

2. Input: 12345
    Output: "12345 is not a Palindrome."

3. Input: "Able was I saw Elba"
    Output: "Able was I saw Elba is a Palindrome."

4. Input: "123!@#321"
    Output: "123!@#321 is a Palindrome."

Feel free to add more test cases to ensure the accuracy of the palindrome checker.
